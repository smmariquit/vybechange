- **Python** for backend and orchestration
- **Streamlit** for interactive dashboards
- **LangChain** for agentic AI logic
- **Gemini (Google Generative AI)** for LLM-powered reasoning and explanations
- **Plotly & Pandas** for data visualization and analytics
- **FastAPI** for API endpoints and integration
A smart donation layer embedded into BPI's Vybe online banking app. It detects when users are most likely to give, nudges them with localized, hyper-relevant causes, and delivers verified proof when their change creates real-world impact. No spam, no guesswork. Just sense.

This demo showcases:
- Automatic round-up: Every purchase in the Vybe online banking app is rounded up to the nearest tens (e.g., ₱127 → ₱130, donate ₱3). Donation suggestions are agentically determined based on user context, not random or fixed.
- Agentic AI: Likelihood scores and suggested donation amounts are generated by autonomous agents using behavioral, contextual, and historical data—not static values. The system adapts to each user and transaction.
- Explainable AI decisions: Powered by Google Gemini via LangChain, every prompt and recommendation is transparent and human-readable.
- Real-time impact tracking
- Modern, judge-facing UI/UX

For technical details, see the agent architecture and code in `src/agents/core_agents.py`.
**"Small pesos. Big ripple."**  
*By the team that decided microdonations don't have to be boring or bureaucratic.*

## 🚩 THE CORE IDEA
A smart donation layer embedded into BPI's VIBE payment ecosystem. It detects when users are most likely to give, nudges them with localized, hyper-relevant causes, and delivers verified proof when their change creates real-world impact. No spam, no guesswork. Just sense.
| 🧠 **Behavioral Targeting** | Donation prompts adjust based on wallet balance, order size, spend rhythm, location, and emotional timing |
| 📊 **Year-End M-PACSense Wrap** | Like Spotify Wrapped, but for the good you've done |

## ✅ WHAT WE'VE RESOLVED
- 🎯 Integrate via BPI's VIBE, not individual e-commerce stores
- 💸 Donation prompts scale with transaction amount
- 📍 Recommend hyperlocal causes using user region & preferences
- 🧾 Users can opt-in to impact updates, to avoid spamming
- 💯 100% of donations go directly to NGOs, no BPI/partner fees
- 🏆 Year-end impact storytelling is core to user delight
- 📈 Behavioral data (order frequency, timing, confirmation time, etc.) guides donation logic
- 🔗 Must partner directly with NGOs; web scraping is out

## ❓ STRATEGIC UNKNOWNS

| Area | Unknown | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 🤝 **NGO Ops** | How quickly can they submit proof? How often do they update? | Timeliness of impact feedback loop |
| 📦 **UX Scaling** | How often is "too often" for donation prompts? | To avoid fatigue/annoyance |
| 💰 **Donation Psychology** | Are users more generous after big purchases? Or small ones? | To tune the AI's ask logic |
| 🗂️ **Segment Logic** | Are different segments (students vs. parents vs. yuppies) receptive to different causes? | For personalization accuracy |
| ⚖️ **Compliance** | What approvals does BPI need to trigger charitable rounding from its UX? | Can block deployment if ignored |
| 🧾 **Proof Types** | Do users care more about photos, maps, or milestone counters? | Will guide NGO submission requirements |
| 🛠️ **Merchant Support** | Can merchants opt in/out? Can we customize overlays per merchant type? | Affects rollout strategy |
| 📲 **Retargeting Logic** | What gets lapsed donors back? Story? Progress bar? Streaks? | To increase repeat giving |
| 🤷‍♀️ **UX Too Subtle** | Low engagement | A/B test pop-up vs. slide-in vs. pre-check UX. Find the "Goldilocks" zone. |
| 🧱 **BPI Bureaucracy** | Long integration cycles | Ship a sandbox demo + agentic dashboard to excite stakeholders early |

## 🔬 THINGS TO TEST IN NEXT RESEARCH SPRINT
- 💰 Do users feel more inclined to donate after big purchases vs. small ones?
- 📍 Do users prefer to support hyperlocal causes or national efforts?
- 😎 What tone makes users more likely to opt in? (formal vs. Gen-Z tone?)
- 🔁 How often would they be okay being nudged in a week/month?
- 👣 What makes them come back and donate again?
- 🪪 Would they link identity (email/FB/GCash) in exchange for tracking their impact story?
- ⏰ How fast do they expect proof-of-impact to arrive post-donation?

## 🎤 FINAL PITCH CORE
**Vybe Impact is an agentic, AI-powered donation layer embedded in BPI's VIBE payment rails.** It learns when users are most open to giving, shows them personally relevant causes, and delivers real-time updates when their change creates real change.

**It's not charity—it's clarity.**
