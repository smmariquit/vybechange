## 🚀 Deployment
- Data Analytics: [API & Admin Dashboard](https://vybechange.streamlit.app/)
- Mobile App Demo: [Vybe Change on Mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/gJz2wvMeqsjPT9xvPdd1OP/BPI?page-id=61%3A179&node-id=61-180&viewport=293%2C40%2C0.94&t=SU0ETIBB94nmSCE2-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=61%3A180)

A smart donation layer embedded into BPI's Vybe online banking app. It detects when users are most likely to give, nudges them with localized, hyper-relevant causes, and delivers verified proof when their change creates real-world impact. No spam, no guesswork. Just sense.

This demo showcases:
- Automatic round-up: Every purchase in the Vybe online banking app is rounded up to the nearest tens (e.g., ₱127 → ₱130, donate ₱3). Donation suggestions are agentically determined based on user context, not random or fixed.
- Agentic AI: Likelihood scores and suggested donation amounts are generated by autonomous agents using behavioral, contextual, and historical data—not static values. The system adapts to each user and transaction.
- Explainable AI decisions: Powered by Google Gemini via LangChain, every prompt and recommendation is transparent and human-readable.
- Real-time impact tracking

For technical details, see the agent architecture and code in `src/agents/core_agents.py`.

## 🚩 THE CORE IDEA
A smart donation layer embedded into BPI's VIBE payment ecosystem. It detects when users are most likely to give, nudges them with localized, hyper-relevant causes, and delivers verified proof when their change creates real-world impact.

## ✅ WHAT WE'VE RESOLVED
- 🎯 Integrate via BPI's VIBE, not individual e-commerce stores
- 💸 Donation prompts scale with transaction amount
- 📍 Recommend hyperlocal causes using user region & preferences
- 🧾 Users can opt-in to impact updates, to avoid spamming
- 💯 100% of donations go directly to NGOs, no BPI/partner fees
- 🏆 Year-end impact storytelling is core to user delight
- 📈 Behavioral data (order frequency, timing, confirmation time, etc.) guides donation logic
- 🔗 Must partner directly with NGOs; web scraping is out

## 🛠️ Developer Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (if working with frontend or integration)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (for dashboard)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smmariquit/vybe-change.git
cd vybe-change
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_demo.py
```

### 5. Run the API Server (FastAPI)
```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

### 6. Run Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 🧩 Environment & Configuration
- All sensitive keys (e.g., Gemini API) should be stored in `.env` (never commit secrets).
- See `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
- For custom agent logic, see `src/agents/`.
