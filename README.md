- **Python** for backend and orchestration
- **Streamlit** for interactive dashboards
- **LangChain** for agentic AI logic
- **Gemini (Google Generative AI)** for LLM-powered reasoning and explanations
- **Plotly & Pandas** for data visualization and analytics
- **FastAPI** for API endpoints and integration
A smart donation layer embedded into BPI's Vybe online banking app. It detects when users are most likely to give, nudges them with localized, hyper-relevant causes, and delivers verified proof when their change creates real-world impact. No spam, no guesswork. Just sense.

This demo showcases:
- Automatic round-up: Every purchase in the Vybe online banking app is rounded up to the nearest tens (e.g., ₱127 → ₱130, donate ₱3). Donation suggestions are agentically determined based on user context, not random or fixed.
- Agentic AI: Likelihood scores and suggested donation amounts are generated by autonomous agents using behavioral, contextual, and historical data—not static values. The system adapts to each user and transaction.
- Explainable AI decisions: Powered by Google Gemini via LangChain, every prompt and recommendation is transparent and human-readable.
- Real-time impact tracking


For technical details, see the agent architecture and code in `src/agents/core_agents.py`.
**"Small pesos. Big ripple."**  
*By the team that decided microdonations don't have to be boring or bureaucratic.*

## 🚩 THE CORE IDEA
A smart donation layer embedded into BPI's VIBE payment ecosystem. It detects when users are most likely to give, nudges them with localized, hyper-relevant causes, and delivers verified proof when their change creates real-world impact. No spam, no guesswork. Just sense.
| 🧠 **Behavioral Targeting** | Donation prompts adjust based on wallet balance, order size, spend rhythm, location, and emotional timing |
| 📊 **Year-End M-PACSense Wrap** | Like Spotify Wrapped, but for the good you've done |

## ✅ WHAT WE'VE RESOLVED
- 🎯 Integrate via BPI's VIBE, not individual e-commerce stores
- 💸 Donation prompts scale with transaction amount
- 📍 Recommend hyperlocal causes using user region & preferences
- 🧾 Users can opt-in to impact updates, to avoid spamming
- 💯 100% of donations go directly to NGOs, no BPI/partner fees
- 🏆 Year-end impact storytelling is core to user delight
- 📈 Behavioral data (order frequency, timing, confirmation time, etc.) guides donation logic
- 🔗 Must partner directly with NGOs; web scraping is out
